## Vision Statement
The “Emotion Diary” project envisions a world where technology helps individuals understand and regulate their emotions through conscious self-reflection.
 
It is a web-based emotional journaling platform powered by AI analysis that helps users track mood dynamics, recognize emotional patterns, and develop emotional intelligence (EQ).

The system combines daily journaling, emotion recognition, and personalized insights to make self-reflection an accessible, evidence-based, and engaging part of everyday life.
