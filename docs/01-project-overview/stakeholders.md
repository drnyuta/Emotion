## User Personas

### Persona 1: Alex - The Analytical Reflector

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Role** | UX Designer, 30 years old |
| **Age** | 30 |
| **Tech Savviness** | High - comfortable with digital tools and APIs |
| **Background** | Has been keeping digital and paper journals for several years; disciplined but feels manual journaling lacks feedback and analytical depth |
| **Goals** | Automate emotion tracking and gain analytical insights; visualize mood trends and emotional triggers; receive AI-generated summaries highlighting personal growth; export and review historical data easily |
| **Frustrations** | Manual journaling is time-consuming and repetitive; reviewing past entries requires too much effort; hard to detect emotional patterns without analytics; wants balance between personalization and automation (AI insights but not robotic tone) |
| **Behavior Patterns** | Logs emotions daily, typically in the evening; uses both text entries and emotion selection tools; reviews weekly reports to adjust lifestyle or mindset; values data visualization and progress tracking |
| **Needs** | AI-assisted journaling tool that analyzes patterns automatically; clear data visualization (charts, summaries, highlights); seamless UX that doesn't interrupt reflection flow |
| **Quote** | "I already write about my emotions, now I want my journal to actually show me what's changing over time." |
| **Scenario** | Alex finishes a stressful workday and opens Emotion Diary. He writes a brief entry about project deadline pressure, selects "anxious" and "overwhelmed" as emotions, and saves. The app generates a daily AI report identifying work deadlines as a recurring trigger. On Sunday, Alex reviews his weekly report, which shows anxiety peaked mid-week and recommends boundary-setting techniques. He saves key insights to his personal library for future reference. |

### Persona 2: Maya - The Guided Beginner

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Role** | Psychology Student, 20 years old |
| **Age** | 20 |
| **Tech Savviness** | Medium - uses apps daily but not deeply technical |
| **Background** | Has never kept a consistent emotional journal; self-aware but finds it hard to name or describe feelings; interested in emotional intelligence and personal growth but needs structure and guidance |
| **Goals** | Learn to identify and name emotions accurately; build consistent habit of daily reflection; understand emotional patterns and their impact on mood; gain confidence in emotional self-awareness |
| **Frustrations** | Doesn't know how to describe feelings precisely; feels lost when faced with blank page; gets discouraged easily if process feels too abstract or "psychological"; needs emotional support without feeling judged |
| **Behavior Patterns** | Uses app in short sessions once per day; relies heavily on predefined questions and prompts; checks weekly summaries to see emotional improvement; values encouragement and progress indicators |
| **Needs** | Guided journaling experience with emotion dictionary and prompts; simple, friendly interface encouraging daily use; motivational system (streaks, gentle feedback); clear progress indicators to build confidence |
| **Quote** | "I want to understand myself better. But I need help learning where to start and how to put my emotions into words." |
| **Scenario** | Maya opens the app unsure what to write. She navigates to "Question of the Day" and selects "What made you feel most alive today?" The question auto-fills in her journal input. She writes about presenting in class, explores the Emotion Wheel to identify she felt "proud" and "nervous," and saves her entry. Her streak counter shows 5 days—she feels motivated to continue. Later, she reads her weekly AI report and learns presentations trigger a mix of pride and anxiety, with recommendations for managing performance nerves. |
