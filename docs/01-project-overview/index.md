## Executive Summary

Emotion Diary is a web-based emotional journaling platform that helps young adults track their emotional patterns, develop emotional intelligence, and maintain consistent self-reflection habits through AI-powered analysis and guided journaling. 

The application addresses the growing mental health crisis, particularly among Generation Z (where 42% have been diagnosed with mental health conditions), by providing an accessible, privacy-focused tool for emotional awareness. 

It combines daily journaling, emotion tracking, educational resources, and personalized AI insights to transform emotional self-reflection from an abstract concept into an evidence-based, engaging daily practice. 

Key outcomes include improved emotional literacy, pattern recognition in mood dynamics, and sustainable journaling habits supported by gamification and meaningful AI feedback.
