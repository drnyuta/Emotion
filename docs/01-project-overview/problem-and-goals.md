# Problem Statement & Goals

## Context

The emotional wellness and mental health landscape is experiencing a critical crisis, particularly among young adults. According to the World Health Organization (2023), over 280 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Generation Z is especially affected, with 42% having been diagnosed with mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression. Despite growing awareness of mental health issues through social media and psychology discourse, most people lack practical tools and education to understand and manage their emotions effectively.

The market for emotional wellness apps is expanding, but existing solutions fall short in several ways: they often hide subscription requirements, provide superficial AI feedback that simply mirrors user statements, suffer from poor UX that disrupts the journaling experience, and lack educational components to help users develop emotional literacy. Many apps focus solely on mood logging without providing meaningful analysis or insights into emotional patterns and triggers.

At the same time, emotional intelligence (EQ) is rarely taught formally in educational institutions or workplaces. Research confirms that conscious perception and analysis of emotions can significantly reduce anxiety and depression levels (Gross, 2015; Li et al., 2020). However, people typically learn to understand emotions only through personal experience - often after facing significant problems.

## Problem Statement

**Who:** Young adults aged 17-35 (students, freelancers, early-career professionals) who are interested in self-development, psychology, and mental health but lack structured tools for emotional awareness.

**What:** They struggle to recognize, name, and understand their emotions, leading to impulsive reactions, difficulty handling stress, problems in relationships, and feelings of being emotionally "out of control." Existing journaling apps either lack analytical depth, hide features behind paywalls, or provide frustrating user experiences that discourage consistent use.

**Why:** Low emotional intelligence leads to decreased well-being, increased anxiety and depression, difficulty navigating personal and professional relationships, and reduced ability to cope with life stressors. Without accessible tools that combine education, reflection, and analysis, individuals continue to struggle with emotional regulation - a fundamental life skill that impacts mental health, career success, and relationship quality.

### Pain Points

| # | Pain Point | Severity | Current Workaround |
|---|------------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Unable to identify and name specific emotions beyond basic feelings (happy, sad, angry) | High | Use vague descriptions or avoid emotional reflection entirely |
| 2 | Don't understand why certain emotions arise or what triggers emotional responses | High | Trial and error, seeking therapy (expensive/inaccessible), ignoring patterns |
| 3 | Blank page paralysis - don't know what to write or how to start journaling | Medium | Abandon journaling attempts, use unstructured notes apps, paper journals without guidance |
| 4 | Existing apps hide subscription requirements and provide superficial AI feedback | High | Pay for subscriptions reluctantly, switch apps frequently, use free basic versions |
| 5 | Poor journaling UX (text field issues, no autosave, can't export data) disrupts emotional reflection | Medium | Tolerate frustration, switch to paper, lose data when changing devices |
| 6 | Limited emotion tracking scales (5-point happy/sad) don't capture emotional nuance | Medium | Force feelings into inadequate categories, add manual notes, skip entries |
| 7 | No way to identify long-term emotional patterns or behavioral triggers without manual review | Medium | Manually re-read old entries (time-consuming), rely on memory (unreliable) |
| 8 | Lack motivation to journal consistently without feedback or progress indicators | Medium | Start and abandon journaling habits repeatedly, feel guilty about inconsistency |

## Business Goals

## Non-Goals

What this project explicitly does NOT aim to achieve:

- **Replace professional psychological care or therapy** - The app is a self-reflection tool, not medical advice
- **Commercial launch during MVP phase** - Focus is on local demonstration and academic evaluation
- **Real-time crisis intervention or emergency support** - Not designed for acute mental health emergencies
- **Integration with health tracking devices or external platforms** - For now maintains focus on core journaling and analysis features
- **Monetization, payment processing, or subscription management** - MVP is free for testing users
- **Multi-language support** - English only for MVP
- **Social features or community elements** - Remains a private, personal tool
- **Advanced AI features like dynamic question generation or conversational AI therapy** - AI limited to emotion analysis and report generation
